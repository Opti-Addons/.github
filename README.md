# Opti.Addons project

The idea of the Opti.Addons is to have extended, improved, or new features that are not available in the standard Optimizely (a.k.a. EPiServer) CMS or Commerce.

Features that are:

* small
* easy to use
* easy to maintain
* well-documented
* versionable
* forkable
* deployed to NuGet.org
