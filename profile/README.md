## 🧩 Opti.Addons project

The idea of the Opti.Addons is to have extended, improved, or new features that are not available in the standard Optimizely (a.k.a. EPiServer) CMS or Commerce.

🙋‍♀️ Features that are:

* small
* easy to use
* easy to maintain
* well-documented
* versionable
* forkable
* deployed to NuGet.org

🌈 Please feel to contribute by adding a feature, bugfix, suggestion, or leave a thank you note!
